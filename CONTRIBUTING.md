# Contributing to RTSLytics

Thanks for your interest in improving RTSLytics! This is an Age of Empires IV
companion + analytics app. Contributions of all kinds are
welcome — bug reports, build orders, guides, civ data, and code.

## The one hard rule (please read)

RTSLytics is **read-only**. It works only from:

- the user's **own local AoE4 files** (logs, match history, replay headers), and
- **public APIs** (AoE4World, Relic community API).

**Never read game memory. Never modify the game. Never attach to or inject into
the game process.** This keeps the app safe under the game's Terms of Service and
is load-bearing for the whole project. PRs that cross this line will be declined,
however cool the feature. If you're unsure whether something is allowed, open an
issue first.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- **Node.js 22** (see `.nvmrc`) and npm.
- On **Windows**, the native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `uiohook-napi`) may
  compile from source if no prebuilt binary matches. If `npm install` fails on
  them, install the
  [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  ("Desktop development with C++") and a matching Python 3.

```bash
npm install     # installs deps and rebuilds native modules for Electron's ABI
npm run dev      # electron-vite dev (main + overlay), hot reload
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (node + web projects)
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # vitest run (all)
npm run verify       # typecheck + lint + test
npm run format       # prettier --write .
npm run pack         # production build → release/win-unpacked/RTSLytics.exe
npm run dist         # portable .exe → release/
```

## Before you open a PR

Please make sure the full verification suite is green:

```bash
npm run verify
```

For changes to the overlay, the Electron main process, or native/local-data
features, also run `npm run pack` and smoke-test the packaged build — those
features need the real game running and can't be covered by unit tests alone.

## How the project is laid out

RTSLytics has **one Electron main process and two renderer windows**:

| Layer                   | Where                                             | What it does                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main** (Node)         | `electron/`                                       | All IO: file reads, the AoE4World + Relic API clients, polling, the overlay controller, native input hook. |
| **Preload**             | `electron/ipc/contract.ts`, `electron/preload.ts` | The typed bridge. `contract.ts` is the **single source of truth** for IPC; it exposes `window.rtslytics`.  |
| **Renderer — main app** | `src/renderer/main/`                              | The dashboard UI (React). Talks to main **only** through IPC.                                              |
| **Renderer — overlay**  | `src/renderer/overlay/`                           | The transparent, click-through in-game overlay.                                                            |
| **Domain** (pure)       | `src/domain/`                                     | The real logic — parsers, analysis, counters, scouting. Pure and Vitest-tested; no IO.                     |
| **Store**               | `src/store/`                                      | Settings (JSON) and analyzed-match history (SQLite, JSON fallback).                                        |
| **Data**                | `src/data/`                                       | Bundled build orders + vendored AoE4World data/flags (see NOTICE).                                         |

Rules of thumb:

- **The renderer never calls an API or reads a file directly** — only through IPC.
- **Put real logic in `src/domain/` (pure, tested); put IO in `electron/services/`.**
- **Add a feature contract-first:** edit `electron/ipc/contract.ts`, then
  `preload.ts`, then the handler/controller, then the renderer hook.
- Path aliases: `@domain`, `@api`, `@store`, `@ipc`, `@shared`, `@data`.

## Contributing data (no code required)

- **Build orders** live in `src/data/buildOrders/` as JSON (CraftySalamander /
  aoe4guides-compatible format). Import and register each file in
  `src/data/buildOrders/index.ts`; list order determines the default build for a
  civilization.
- **Guides** live in `src/data/guides.ts`.

## Platform notes

RTSLytics is **Windows-first**: the overlay, local-file reading, and the APM
input hook are Windows-only. The dashboard, scout, civ meta, tier lists, and
guides work cross-platform (they're powered by the public APIs). Cross-platform
fixes are welcome.

## Commit & PR conventions

- Branch off `main`.
- Keep PRs focused; describe **what** changed and **why**.
- Reference an issue where one exists.
- If you touched anything under the read-only rule above, say so explicitly in
  the PR description.
