Age of Empires IV companion for scouting, overlay help, and post-game stats.

RTSLytics is read-only. It uses public APIs and your own local AoE4 files.

## Features

- Pre-game scouting: opponent rank, rating, recent form, favorite civs, recent public matches, and exact personal head-to-head history.
- Team plans: practical roles and priorities based on the public civilization lineup.
- In-game overlay: top matchup bar, civ flags, ranks, key units, counters, win odds by rating, and optional live APM.
- Adaptive Build Coach: conditional responses during a match and evidence-linked recovery plans after it.
- Session tracker: today's record at a glance ("3W – 1L +42") on the overlay, so a losing streak is visible without leaving the game.
- Live match clock widgets: a step-by-step build-order guide (pin any build from Guides) and age-up pace targets for your rank, driven by the real game clock (your own log file, pauses included).
- Post-game review: result card, Turning-Point Story, economy grade, APM, trends, and raw team contribution breakdowns.
- Benchmark Lens: compare recent stretches and filtered personal samples with the sample size shown for every metric.
- Matchup Lab: global directional matchup data and personal local results, kept separate with honest sample counts.
- Data Studio: filter local history by civ, opponent, map, format, patch or season, result, duration, and time window; filtered views can be bookmarked.
- Guides and data: civ pages, tier lists, counters, build orders, landmarks, and matchup stats. Written guides are marked work in progress while they are updated.
- Local support: ranked, Quick Match, custom games, and vs-AI where local files provide the data.

Many bundled build orders are adapted from community submissions on [AoE4Guides](https://aoe4guides.com/). Sourced builds credit their original authors and link back to the source in the app.

## Download

Use the latest portable Windows release:

https://github.com/m4rc3lsowhat/AOE4-Analytics/releases/latest

Download `RTSLytics-*-portable.exe` and run it. No installer is required.

## Requirements

- Windows for the full overlay and local-file features.
- Node.js 22 (see [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc)) and npm for development.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run verify
npm run pack
npm run dist
```

`npm run dist` builds the portable `.exe` in `release/`.

## Overlay

Run AoE4 in Borderless or Windowed Fullscreen. The overlay appears when RTSLytics detects a live match.

Hotkeys (defaults — rebindable in Settings → Overlay):

```text
Alt + O           show / hide overlay
Ctrl + Alt + O    move overlay widgets (placement mode)
```

## Local Data

On Windows, RTSLytics reads files under:

```text
Documents\My Games\Age of Empires IV
```

Used files include logs, session data, match history, and replay headers. This data stays on your machine. RTSLytics makes network requests only to AoE4World, the Relic community API, and — if you connect Steam — Steam and its stat-summary blob host. See [Privacy & security](#privacy--security).

## Data Sources

- Relic community API for scouting and match data.
- AoE4World API for search, ladder data, tier lists, matchups, and maps.
- Vendored AoE4World data and flags.
- Local AoE4 files for live detection and post-game stats.

## Steam sign-in (optional)

Connecting Steam is optional and only used to download your own ranked post-game stat summaries (exact economy, age-up timings) from Relic. QR approval is the recommended method. If you use password sign-in, your password is sent only to Steam for that one login and is never stored; the saved session token is encrypted with your OS keychain.

## Privacy & security

RTSLytics is read-only and keeps your game data on your machine.

## Architecture

RTSLytics has one Electron **main** process (`electron/`) that owns all IO and the API clients, a typed **preload** bridge (`electron/ipc/contract.ts`), and two React renderer windows — the dashboard (`src/renderer/main/`) and the transparent overlay (`src/renderer/overlay/`). The real logic lives in a pure, Vitest-tested domain layer (`src/domain/`); renderers only talk to the main process through IPC. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full map.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — code, build orders, and guides. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) first (especially the read-only rule), and run `npm run verify` before opening a PR.
